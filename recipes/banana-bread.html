    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ooh, here we go again, another wall of text for you to speed-scroll past</p>
    <p>Seriously though, why is this a <em>thing</em> on recipe sites?</p>
    <p>Why can't you just give me the damn recipe???</p>
    <p>Anyway, here it is</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Some bananas or some shit, idc</li>
        <li>Butter, I guess, that sounds right</li>
        <li>Need some sugar too, gotta have sugar. Brown is good</li>
        <li>Eggs. Yeah, that sounds right</li>
        <li>Plain flour</li>
        <li>Uh, bicarb of soda? I think. I'm writing this from memory. My memory sucks</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips, cus who doesn't like extra chocolatey goodness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You're supposed to preheat the oven at this point but if you're anything like me you won't bother then you'll wonder why the baking instructions never work</li>
        <li>Now, mash up the bananas, mix with the wet ingredients</li>
        <li>If you can be arsed, sieve the flour and mix together with dry ingredients</li>
        <li>Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients and bang, there ya go</li>
        <li>Spoon into greased & lined loaf tin. Wait, did I tell you to grease and line the tin first? Yeah, you were supposed to do that</li>
        <li>Bake. For how long?? Well, until it's cooked. Genius.</li>
    </ol>
